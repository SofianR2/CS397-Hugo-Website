# Hi, my name is Sofian! {#about}

Hello! I'm Sofian Rahhali, an incoming SDE at Amazon and a current senior at Northwestern University pursuing a BA/MS in Computer Science.
During my time here, I've learned a lot about creating modern, scalable, and responsive software solutions.

I specialize in back-end development using technologies like Python, C++, and Node.js, but I'm
also comfortable working with front-end technologies like React or Tailwind CSS and other technolgoies such as AWS and GraphQL.

My love for technology began when I first built my pc in 7th grade, and I was introduced to coding in my senior year of high school. 
Since then, I've honed my skills through working on various technical projects and internship experiences. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing soccer, volleyball, or my favorite video games. My favorite soccer team is Tottenham Hotspur.
I also enjoy going to the gym, listening/playing to music, and learning about the latest tech.
